Problem is the large clinical size - the 2 biopsies may be one large lesion. I think it is too large for regular excision.If he doesn't want surgery, he might do fine with Efudex as there does not appear to be deep invasion. We could treat and see if anything is left.\"\n",

Discussed with the patient that observation is acceptable, however did still discussed that the most definitive treatment is surgery at this point.
