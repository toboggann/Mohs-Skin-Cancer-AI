====================================
- Model Accuracy (CF):

========Initial run========
# of Correct Predictions = 282
Sample Size = 294
Accuracy = 95.92%

Number of Notes without a Given CF = 3
Accuracy = 96.91%

Number of PE/A&P/A Notes without a valid GPT Given CF = 0
Accuracy = 95.92%

Number of Combined Notes without a Given CF = 3
Accuracy = 96.91%

Confusion Matrix:
TP: 11
TN: 271
FP: 4
FN: 5

Confusion Matrix Metrics:
accuracy: 96.91
precision: 73.33
recall: 68.75
F1: 70.97



========V2========
Since there are only 16 TP I need to increase the precision significantly as well as the recal and F1
I continued to try and change the system_context and the question but it remained the same throughout.

# of Correct Predictions = 283
Sample Size = 294
Accuracy = 96.26%

Number of Notes without a Given CF = 3
Accuracy = 97.25%

Number of PE/A&P/A Notes without a valid GPT Given CF = 0
Accuracy = 96.26%

Number of Combined Notes without a Given CF = 3
Accuracy = 97.25%

Confusion Matrix:

accuracy: 97.25
precision: 75.00
recall: 75.00
F1: 75.00


========V3========
I made the que a shorter. This whole time I have been making it have other information so I made it just a question instead and it improved.

Issues:
FP: 49,59,133,180
I changed it so the prompt included Explicit rejection of empirical C&F before pathology confirmation, 
Rejects “follow-up” or “loose planning” without firm decision, and accepts co-scheduled C&F only if clearly elected and mapped

FN: 39,67
I made the model accept tentative language when pathology is confirmed + lesion-level mapping is present
