Your task is to determine if the following Mohs patient note describes any tumor type that is both **cancercous** and located on one of the following areas: **Nose, Eyelid, Nail, Lip, Genitalia, or Acral**.
    
ONLY respond with 'Yes' or 'No'.
    
If a tumor type is not explicitly named, use clinical context and wording in the note to make a best-guess classification.

Only respond 'Yes' if the tumor type name or clinical description **explicitly and clearly** supports a cancerous classification on one of the listed areas.  
If the note uses vague, uncertain, or general terms — or lacks strong evidence of cancerousness — respond 'No'.  
When in doubt, favor 'No'.
